## Introduction

### Early Operation Systsms :
> Computer are very Expensive
- **One application at a time**
  - Had complete control of hardware : ONE APPLICATION
  - OS was runtime library (or Systems Library eg. <stdio.h>) : NO OS
  - Users would stand in line to use the computer : QUEUE
- **Batch systems** : automatically load the new input (program) after the program terminal detected
  - Keep CPU busy by having queue of jobs
  - OS would load next job while currnt one runs
  - Users would submit jobs (analogy: in the "tray" of printer I/P), and wait ,and wait, and wait...
